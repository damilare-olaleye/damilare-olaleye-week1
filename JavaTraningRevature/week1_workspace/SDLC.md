# Software Development Lifecycle

The software development lifecyle is a process to follow when developing software. The SDLC defines the phases necessary for a project from its initial creation to deployment and maintenance.

# SDLC Phases
1. Requirements Phase
    - Phase where planning for the upcoming project happens
    - What needs to be developed?
    - What sort of functionality are we envisioning?
    - What is the project schedule going to look like?
    - Business Analysts (BAs) + Senior team members
2. Analysis Phase
    - Gather together documents (requirements) for the new system
    - Resolve any ambiguites and inconsistencies in the requirements
    - A software requirement specification document (SRS) is created
        - Software and hardware requirements are formally defined
    - BAs + Senior developers
3. Design Phase
    - Outline technical details for the application 
        - Infrastructure 
        - Database structure
        - System interfaces
        - User interfaces
    - Psuedo-code, diagrams, wireframes, etc. 
    - System architects + Senior developers, UX designers.
    - Design documents are produced
4. Development Phase
    - Developers write code and build the application based on the design documents
    - Junior + Senior developers
5. Testing Phase
    - Equally as important as the development phase
    - The software is tested to find bugs
    - Bugs that are found are fixed
    - The software at the end of this phase should meet the requirements laid out in the requirements and analysis phases
    - QA members (Testers) + Develoopers
6. Deployment Phase
    - The application is deployed to deicated servers for hosting it
    - System Administrators + Developers
7. Maintenance Phase
    - Ensure that the system is up and functional and has high availability
    - Resolve new issues (bugs) based on user reports
    - Developers + System Administrators + Site Relability Engineers +  Customer support + QAs + Business Analysts (receiving feedback from the customer).

# Conclusion 
These phases are a high level description of the software development lifecycle. The details depend on how we chose to follow the SDLC.

There are 2 main competing philosophies:
- Waterfall
- Agile
